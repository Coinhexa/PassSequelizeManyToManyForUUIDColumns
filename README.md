# Sequelize Many To Many Association With UUID Ids

This app was bootstrapped with [Imagine.ai](https://imagine.ai) ðŸ’›
> Imagine.ai is an app starter on steroids!
The purpose of this app is to demonstrate that npm run test succeeds when run on a sequelize model User and a sequelize model Role having a many to many relationship via RoleUser both having UUID userId and roleId on sequelize version 6.20.1 whereas the tests fail if the data type of userId and roleId was integer instead on the postgres dialect

POSTGRES_USER=<username-for-database>
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<password-to-database>
DB_DIALECT=postgres
```
